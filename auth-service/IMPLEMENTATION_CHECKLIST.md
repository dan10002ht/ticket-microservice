## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Details

### Completed in Phase 1:

1. **Protobuf Definitions** (`shared-lib/protos/auth.proto`)
   - Added `AuthorizationService` with methods:
     - `CheckPermission`
     - `CheckResourcePermission`
     - `GetUserRoles`
     - `BatchCheckPermissions`

2. **Authorization Controller** (`auth-service/src/controllers/authorizationController.js`)
   - Implemented all gRPC methods
   - Added proper error handling
   - Integrated with permission and role services

3. **Enhanced Permission Service** (`auth-service/src/services/internal/permissionService.js`)
   - Added caching for permissions
   - Implemented batch permission checking
   - Added Redis integration

4. **Cache Service Updates** (`auth-service/src/services/internal/cacheService.js`)
   - Added permission caching methods
   - Implemented cache invalidation
   - Added TTL management

5. **gRPC Server Registration** (`auth-service/src/server.js`)
   - Registered AuthorizationService
   - Added proper error handling

---

## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

### Current Implementation:

- **gRPC Communication**: All auth requests go through gRPC
- **Redis Caching**: Permissions cached with TTL
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses

### Performance Optimizations:

- Permission caching with 5-minute TTL
- Batch permission checking
- Connection pooling for database
- Redis for fast permission lookups

---

## ðŸ§ª Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests:

- [ ] Permission service tests
- [ ] Role service tests
- [ ] Cache service tests
- [ ] Controller tests

### Integration Tests:

- [ ] gRPC endpoint tests
- [ ] Database integration tests
- [ ] Redis integration tests

### End-to-End Tests:

- [ ] Complete authorization flows
- [ ] Gateway integration tests
- [ ] Performance tests

## ðŸ“Š Metrics & Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track:

- Authorization request latency
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- Permission check success/failure rates
- Database query performance
- Redis connection health

### Alerts to Set Up:

- High authorization latency
- Cache miss rate spikes
- Database connection issues
- Redis connection failures
- Authorization failure rate increases
